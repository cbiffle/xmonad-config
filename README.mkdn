XMonad Configuration
====================

This is my current configuration for the XMonad window manager.  I run XMonad
without a desktop environment.

This configuration includes:

- My custom "Terminal" layout, which sizes xterms to 80 columns.
- Support for two monitors with separate xmobars.
- Cutesy layout icons in place of names.
- A custom layout modifier on one workspace (3).
- Volume and backlight controls.
